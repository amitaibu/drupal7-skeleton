# Linux or Mac OSX

The scripts in this skeleton are written in Bash, you need to have a Linux or Mac OSX environment to run these scripts.

Support to run the profile within a Vagrant box will be added later.


# PHP

Drupal needs a local PHP hosting (LAMP/MAMP). PHP 5.4 or higher is recommended.


# Drush 6

The scripts use [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) to download the Drupal core & contributed modules. Drush is also used to install & upgrade the local installation.

See the [installation instructions for Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush#installupdate---composer). Use Drush 6.
